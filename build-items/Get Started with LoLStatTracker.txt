How to get started with LoLStatTracker:
1. Double click 'SetupLoLStatTracker.bat'. 
2. You will be asked if you want to allow a file starting with setup-couchdb to make changes to your computer
	-If you already have CouchDB installed (possible, but unlikely), then click no. Set up is done!
	-If you do NOT already have CouchDB installed (if you're unsure, you most likely don't have it), then click yes.
	 Make sure the box for 'Run as a windows service' is checked. It should be selected automatically,
	 but double check as this setting is required for LoLStatTracker to work properly.
3. Double click 'LoLStatTrackerStart.bat' to begin. 
4. When prompted, enter your summoner name (your name in League of Legends)
5. Click the 'Update History' button at the bottom of the screen.
6. **IMPORTANT NOTE** This step WILL log you out if you are logged into the League of Legends client.
   Enter the information you use to log in to League of Legends, including selecting
   your server from the drop down menu. This information is used immediately and not saved locally.
  
7. Congratulations! You can now see your 10 most recent matches! When you play more games,
   load up LoLStatTracker again and use the Update History button. For more information
